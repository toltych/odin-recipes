        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a tried and true method for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs... and the only method I've used for years.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 Large Eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place eggs in a saucepan and pour in cold water to cover; place over high heat. When water starts to simmer and eggs start to dance around a little, turn off heat, cover the pan quickly with a lid, and let stand for 17 minutes. Don't peek.</li>
                <li>Pour out hot water and pour cold water over eggs. Drain and refill with cold water; let stand until eggs are cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Peel eggs under running water.</li>
            </ol>
